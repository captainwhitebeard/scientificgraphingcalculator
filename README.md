standardScientificGraphingUnitConvertingCalculator

 A basic and scientific calculator with temperature, speed, time, distance unit conversion with the start of a sin wave graph. I am slowly learning more but I would like a graphing portion to take whatever functions one has, then display this on either another jFrame or a jPanel within the parent JFrame.  I am over my skill limit to be sure, yet the challenge and desire to learn overshadows all fear. I enjoy the process of learning. When I tried to attach a file, computer froze and my mouse was moving about the screen without my hand on it. In anycase, I had to down the PC the old bad fashioned way. 
 
 I plan on uploading the screen shots and the java files but right now, it is the Sabbath and I am a bit concerned for I don't want my pc hacked.
 I don't like to be messed me one bit. None of us should!
